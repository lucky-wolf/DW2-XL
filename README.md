## Guiding Principles
Principally this mod aims to create a better player experience while playing games of Distant Worlds 2.

It is not a completely different game than vanilla, rather it's improved in ways I had time or insight to do so. Many technologies are extended to go to higher levels, or to make tech progression more of a better, better, best progression, rather than having to backtrack.  Similarly, looking for ways to make sure that technology trees - different paths - really have some distinct advantages and disadvantages compared to other choices.  The intention is to make it make your decisions matter, have clear(er) differentiation, and allow greater replay (rather than choices that aren't -- where one is very obviously the best, and the others are just window-dressing).

YMMV, but this is my take on making it Extra Large!

## Mod Highlights
- Colonizable worlds are fewer, and races are more specialized to their preferred type of worlds
- Terraforming technology has multiple levels giving you the ability, at a significant cost, to terraform even barely colonizable worlds to paradise... eventually
- Almost all racial tech is viable throughout the game, and that which isn't, merges into the main line on its own so you don't need to re-do research in a different branch
- Racial tech also unlocks things like defense facilities giving you all the goodies from your race's special tech line
- Engine technology lines are more heavily specialized
- Warp technology is now more strongly differentiated
  - Snap drives prioritize minimizing jump transition time
  - Sojourn drives prioritize range
  - Hyperstream drives prioritize flight-speed
  - Smart drives prioritize energy efficiency
- AIs will have a racial preference for their own warp drives (not all races want the same thing)
- Tech lines that bog down the game with useless non-choices are removed, simplified, or deepened to have an appreciable impact on gameplay
  - Vectoring thrusters are gone
  - The dead-end Ackdarian specialized interceptors are gone
- Tech tree is extended for t7 to t10, better arranged, with many more levels of weapons, armor, shields, troops, etc.
- Many new and expanded planetary facilities to build
- Massively rebalanced Weapons, Shields, Armor, general component space use, component size alternates, ship hull sizes, Ion, Point Defenses, Fighters, Hangars, etc.
- Substantially slowed down weapons fire which should help everyone's PC keep up with the game better
  - This seriously improves the look and flow of battles as well!  They look amazing now!

- Began playing with a Go lang tool to do bulk edits on .xml files (wip)

### v1.9.5
- Removed GameEvents.xml because it fails to overwrite the vanilla events, and instead doubles them!

### v1.9.4
- Updated to use beta game engine 1.1.0.3
  - Applied a TON of changes to the ship hull definitions for all major races (missed these from 1.1.0.0)
- This is now a steam workshop item "XL" - please use that to use this mod - it will no longer be supported as a download & merge approach!

### v1.9.3
- Updated to use beta game engine 1.1.0.0
- Balance: Adjusted government turnover rates to be less frequent

### v1.9.2

  - You should be able to assign them home bases and that should be a strong affinity for theater of operations
  - Late game was getting ridiculous with fleets flying literally around the galaxy
- Removed odd-ball Long Range Jump Blocking tech + corresponding GW4000 tech level

### v1.8.4
- Disallowed Haakonish from researching the Large Fuel Storage line (since they have mega dense storage tech-line)

### v1.8.3
- Fixed Void Sensors (Super Sensors) to include fleet targeting bonus (progression of ultra long range sensors)

- Stealth is now size 25
- Ackdarians are locked out of inferior engine techs
  - Improved the Ackdarian engine line to merge into advanced thrusters for end-game tech parity
- Added 1.0.8.8 compatibility changes

### v1.8.0
- Armor
  - Increased resource requirements for early specialized armors
- Sensors
  - Added a line of Mortalen-only sensors that have the same sensor rating as standard sensors at their level, but incorporate the multi-tracking benefits of Mortalen-only tech
- Stealth
  - Increased countermeasure value
- Quantum Capacitors
  - Nerfed shield resistance bonuses
  - Increased size to 20
- Fighters & Bombers
  - Missile systems are now always "large" (size 6)
  - Teekan and Human racial tech-lines now all lead to Space Fighter VIs as the endgame tech
- Star Beams (Zenox only)
  - Added another endgame tier
  - Tweaked / balanced some of their numbers to better align with other techs
- Heavy Rail Guns
  - now have a v3 tier, and
  - are classified as standoff weapons (formerly close-in)
- Pulse Torpedoes (Mortalen only)
  - Extended backwards so that they start at T2 as a specialized tech line
  - Rebalanced to better fit new tech cadence
  - Leads to multi-dimensional plasma torps for endgame
- Pulse Plasma Cannons (Boskara only)
  - Extended another tier for endgame
  - Rebalanced / fixed some number progressions
- Plasma Charge Torpedoes (Boskara only)
  - Leads to multi-dimensional plasma torps for endgame
- Terraforming Facilities
  - cost ramp is shallower
  - maintenance is higher
- Racial Techs
  - All techs which are simply inferior to a racial tech has been disabled for that race
    - This should allow the AIs to waste slightly less time researching things that are just stupid
    - This is kind of ugly in the tech tree - it's up to Matrix to improve their tech viewer and AI logic to improve this situation

### v1.7.1
- Added a 3rd Planetary Shield Generator tech-level, and made them a bit more penetrable
  - level 1 = 25 resistance, 15% penetration
  - level 2 = 50 resistance, 10% penetration
  - level 3 = 75 resistance,  5% penetration
- Reduced stealth size to 20
  - increased stealth value by 100%
  - set jamming power to 1/2 stealth value
- Overhauled Armor tech
  - Added new armor line: Reactive
  - Significantly improved armor blast ratings (hopefully to make a better value proposition vs. shields)
  - [DW2-XL Armor](#dw2-xl-armor)
  - [DW2-XL Fighter/Bomber Armor](#dw2-xl-fighterbomber-armor)

### v1.7.0
- Fixed ship hulls, names, sizes & related tech names to be as intended (was broken by 1.0.8.x builds)
  - Fixed ship hull sizes for all player-races to: [DW2-XL Hull Sizes](#dw2-xl-hull-sizes)
  - Fixed interceptors to always use size 5 weapons, bombers are size 10 (will force the ship designer to actually use both slots, and to define the roles of the two more honestly)
  - Added the `ShipModelHullData` files for all of this to force the game to actually respect these values!
- Tweaked tech tree to hopefully make the mid-game flow a bit better

### v1.6.3
- Reduced "efficient" thrusters to size 16, giving them some possible utility
- Added Hail Cannons \[M\] for Humans
  - Tweaked Hail Cannons and Terminator Cannons to be more sensible, and to give the Humans a slight advantage in their racial tech
- Fixed missing diplomatic specialization center (Universal Peace Center)
- Gave wormhole drive better range (1000M)
- Rebalanced all \[Ftr\] weapons to make better sense in the current tech tree across all weapon-lines and levels
  - Many weapons had their ROF reduced and their dmg/shot increased for a lighter load on the CPU, but effectively same damage output
  - Which also reduces the effectiveness of reflective armor and shields, since more dmg will penetrate, make fighters much more powerful (they were basically gnats to be ignored otherwise)
- Reduced the reflective value of Ion Armors, so that there is more of a trade off between standard armor being both tougher (25%), and better at reflecting damage (2x) vs. ion armors being able to replace ion defense generators (considerable space-savings)

### v1.6.2
- Fixed Talassos Shields v3 and v4 were crazy expensive
- Tweaked all shield recharge rates, strength progression
- Tweaked all reactor power levels and progressions

### v1.6.1
- Zenox can choose technocracy now that the bug with giving them a +20% all research on hw is fixed

  - This includes a very large number of minor component tweaks since this also includes 1.0.8.0 component changes

### v1.6.0
- Tons of improvements, new techs, new components, new facilities
- Fixed bug in Zenox that was giving them a +20 all research at their homeworld (this is also fixed in the next beta from Matrix Games)
- Revamped how diplomatic facilities are obtained
  - added another level to diplomatic facilities
  - you now need multiple diplomatic techs of a certain level to obtain access to diplomatic focus and diplomatic specialization
  - moved espionage facility to its own tech in the diplomatic section
  - it requires a certain number of basic diplomacy with other major powers
  - improved Espionage Facility to improve espionage (go figure!)
- Expanded Zenox star beams
  - they start at tier 2, like other racial weapons in this mod
  - they bifurcate into a fighter-small line, and a medium-large line (also like others in this mod)
  - there is more tier for all star beams at the high end, now
- Rebalanced the shield tech tree
  - shield tech branches at tier 2, so player decides right after deflectors which path to take
  - all shields have been rebalanced against each other
  - advanced shields are available to all research paths at tier 6
- Reorganized much of the weapons, shields and armor techs so they're all together at the start of the tech tree
  - in general, it goes direct fire to seeking and area weapons
- Bombardment weapons now have the designation \[B\] and are of medium slot size (same as a medium seeking weapon)
- Fixed interceptors to definitely always have light weapons
- Improved the base troop templates to use a much more balanced selection of troops
- Updated all planetary facilities to cost 1% operational maintenance
  - this doubles the maintenance cost of many of them
- Increased abhorrence of Boskarans by other races
- Increased diplomacy malus against hive mind by other governments
- Added restrictions so that Boskarans cannot specialize in diplomacy
- Removed all research bonsues from all races, and replaced them with more specific bonuses for that race
- Mildly nerfed technocracy to have only a 15% bonus to all tech (was 20%)
- Fixed all techs so that no groups are split up (all techs of a category are together, in a single block)
- Updated policies to default to capturing all bases instead of only those in your territory

### v1.5.0
- rebalanced the weapons tech tree
  - size \[X\] weapons all are size 150
  - added more tiers for some weapons & point defenses
  - tons of work here filling in & filling out & balancing
- moved up planetary defenses and some other planetary facilities to tier 3
- updated game events so that vector engines are never generated through this path

### v1.4.4
- Increased minimum deposits to at least 10%
- Fixed size of small Velocity Torps
- Updated races.xml for 1.0.7.9

### v1.4.3
- Fighter-interceptors use small weapons for all mounts
- Re-normalized weapons into 11/22/44 for direct fire weapons, and 13/26/52 for seeking, bombing, and AOE weapons

- Tweaked Construction research tree
- Moved up research, research buildings, and terraforming
- Moderated the terraforming facilities
- Moved up terraforming to be a bit earlier in the tech tree
- Reduced tech cost overall

### v1.4.2

- Random tech tree now works
- Significant changes to Sensors
  - Fleet targeting & Fleet countermeasures are now size 10 (was 15)
  - Short Range Sensors are now size 10 (was 5)
  - Long Range Sensors are now size 20 (was 40)
  - Deep Sensor Arrays remain size 40
  - Sensors require the targeting tech that enables that level of targeting bonus (so you need the targeting tech first)
  - There are +2 new, higher level short range sensors (basic, standard, improved, enhanced, advanced)
  - Sensors no longer give you more targeting bonus than the equivalent targeting tech, and they take up 2x ship space (so they continue to fulfil their purpose, are relatively small, but the actual targeting tech has more of a niche to fill, and you can't ignore that in favor of pure sensor tech)
  - Long Range Sensors are one level deeper in the tech tree (and are no longer a requirement for stealth)
  - Fleet Targeting and Countermeasures now start at level 2, instead of 3

### v1.3.7
- Added Heavy Rail Gun [M] v2
  - This gives parity for heavy and light rail guns so that upgraded designs are sensible
- Updated to 1.0.6.9 Beta
  -  Added dual tech requirements to support newest beta engine (no longer defaults to "all required")

### v1.3.6
- Swapped Sojourn & Hyperstream sizes (22<->17) (Hyperstream is now the larger of the two)
- Increased Hyperstream speeds from 650/975/1950/3800 -> 700/1050/2100/4200

### v1.3.5
- Tiny tweaks to Automation Policies

### v1.3.4
- Tweaked fleet templates
  - Added +1/+1 capital ship and carrier to attack template
  - Removed capital ship from raid template
  - Removed all tankers from fleets (engine just cannot use them sensibly still)
- Adjusted AIs
  - Increased constructor production to match explorer (high) to help them grow their economies

### v1.3.3
- Fixed bug in Boskaran's Firestorm v2 tech - was costing 4x too much!
- Tweaked the default fleet templates
  - Added back in some fuel tankers (now that they're arguably marginally less buggy)
  - Gave invasion fleets a Carrier, and Raid fleets a Battleship
  - Switch the defaults so that fleet policies override ship policies
  - Changed the invade to "immediately" to try to avoid situation where they land sporadically (this is fundamentally still a bug in the game itself)
  - Changed fleets to be more willing to retreat - hopefully to give the AI a better ability to trade blows over time and not disintegrate at the first clash
- Increased visibility of nebulas (fixed 1.0.6.6's settings so that they actually work)
- Planetary Facilities
  - Buffed shield facilities
  - Buffed fighter bases
- Adjusted all AIs to try to
  - Better balance their military construction for what they actually need
  - Put more resources into economy (exploration & construction)
  - Avoid building too many fixed defenses (which are a poor investment)
  - Focus on a single tech at a time
  - Grow to worlds that are a little bit borderline, but which they should be able to terraform or tech into good worlds over time

### v1.3.2
- Adjusted Boskarans
  - Adjusted tech level of their specialized torpedo weapons to be on the same cadence as their plasma beams
    - thus ship designs are in parity (latest is latest of each)
  - Added ion defense to flux armor
    - not as good as true Ionic Armor, but better than vanilla
- Buffed planetary defense facilities
  - Doubled planetary weapons volley size (e.g. 3 torpedoes -> 6 torpedoes per shot)
  - +160, +180, +200 targeting and countermeasures (they will hit, and are extremely hard to shoot down)
  - Added a secondary tech that gives planetary beam defense weapons (from pulsed weapons)
- Adjusted multi-role ships to come one tech level sooner

### v1.3.1
- Adjusted AI policies to allocate more cashflow to troops & facilities

### v1.3.0
- Expanded the reactors line to 6-deep for all 3 main techs (caslon fusion, harmonic caslon, coronal)
  - caslon fusion is the most compact but the lowest output and capacity
  - harmonic caslon is 50% larger for 50% more output and 20% more capacity
  - coronal is 100% larger than caslon fusion for 100% more output and 80% greater capacity
  - caslon fusion is the most fuel efficient, harmonic caslon in the middle, and coronal is the worst
- Added AI policies to help them be more competitive

### v1.2.3
- Applied 1.0.6.4 fixes to TroopDefinitions.xml

### v1.2.2
- Fixed vanilla bug in phasers: weapon speed 1500
- Relaxed the tech lines of ionic armor and star marine barracks to be linear, not requiring the normal armor nor the normal crew quarters, but being their own line of research
  - Makes upgrades less of a pain in the butt (and they already cost 2x research vs. their normal variants for the same level of base armor or crew capacity)
- Added one more level of ion sheath armor (equivalent to impervious)
- Upgraded super armor to have ion sheath properties

### v1.2.1
- Normalized all hyperdrives to increase speed of hyperdrives in general (starting above base Sojourn)
  - Sojourn/Torrent gives incremental improvement in all areas for higher research cost overall
  - Snap offers the quickest init & recharge times plus best accuracy, but with limited range and 2nd worst efficiency
  - Hyperstream offers the highest speeds, but with the worst efficiency and poor accuracy
  - Smart offers the longest ranged jumps combined with highly efficient engines and good accuracy, but with somewhat reduced speed and poorest initialize and recharge times
- Super Drives (Flux) now have respectable vector thrust
- +5 Energy to Ftr Reactors (were a bit anemic)

### v1.2.0
- Standardized static energy on colony modules to 1E/1M capacity (e.g. 50M capacity = 50 static energy)
- Improved sizes to be what they were with double modules (50,100,150,200)
- Luxury Barracks give a maintenance savings of 10/15/20/25 at various levels
- Marine Barracks no longer give a maintenance savings (they give boarding defense bonus)
- Applied fixes from DW2 build 1.0.5.8

### v1.1.10
- Incorporated minor race planetary habitability fixes from DW2 build 1.0.5.6

### v1.1.9
- Fixed an issue with Starship Maneuvering where getting that tech through an event would crash the game (mod bug)

### v1.1.8
- Normalized many of the planetary defense facility techs so they become available around the same tech-level
- Updated engines to have meaningful vector thrust values (70-375)

### v1.1.7
- Increased fighter engine output
  - base by 1.25
  - max by 1.5 x base
  - should allow fighters to advance into combat ahead of main fleet & hurry back to carriers when leaving
- Further organized construction, parts of shields, ...
- Tweaked Quick Jump hyperdrives again (a bit slower for less insane energy requirements)

### v1.1.6
- Applied DW2 1.0.5.1 Fixes
  - Kaidian spelling
  - Skip drive sound effects
- Reorganized Troops
  - All troop related tech and facilities is right there under troops
- Reorganized Boarding Pods
  - All boarding related tech is under boarding pots

### v1.1.5
- Revamped engines tech tree & components
  - three distinct choices: efficient, nimble, and maximum speed
  - increased energy consumption of all engines so that this actually makes a difference
  - improved vectoring of nimble, advanced, and Ackdarian engines
  - engine choice is not level 2 (was 3) - makes a nicer tree & decision point
  - extended "ion thrusters" one level to make this work nicely
- Fixed some minor inconsistencies in hyper drive deny blocking
- Improved the hyper deny research tree
- Removed "Robo-" from Zenox troop names (now they're are Ice whatever) since they're not robotic, so it made no sense!

### v1.1.4
- Tweaked Smart hyper drives to make them a little more attractive
- Moved ion defenses to appear near shields && reorganized point deflectors (right next to them)
  - both are rooted in advanced deflectors rather than in weapons techs
- Separated scanners and jammers into their own tech-lines (independent of each other)
- Further tweaked hyperdrives to make long-haul drives truly efficient in multiple analysis (also the most accurate drive)
- Tweaked Snap further to decrease range and increase energy consumption
- Fixed sojourn line to make its accuracy improve continually through the whole series
- Updated hyperdrives to consume similar amounts of energy for what they do, with Smart being most efficient, and Hyperstream least, but Snap now has to pay for its super-speed short-hops.
- Tweaked the Snap line to be fixed range (1.4M) but to be much, much faster (so short, fast hops)
- Fixed: re-disabled the interceptors line (shouldn't have been visible - pointless duplicate of vanilla)
- Got rid of a bunch of cycles in tech tree
- Restored the efficient hyperdrive line
- Made Hyperdrive lines all usable to endgame
  - Kalista-Dal are efficient, slower, but have extreme range (long-haul hyperdrives)
  - Snap have more limited range, but become crazy fast at turnaround times
- Increased the cost of late game tech (and rebalanced the scaling to be pure doubling)
- Rooted the various planetary weapon facilities earlier in their respective trees so that all races should be able to build them without having to research pointless branches just to find that...
- Simplified a lot of the earlier changes I made now that I understand how the tech .xml files work with the engine to use the simplest approach that works reliably

## Research (Tech Tree)
- Some aspects of the tech tree were simplified or reorganized to make it more logical and reasonable.
  - Removes unnecessary dependencies in the tech tree to make it easier to research what you want.
    - For example - it is not necessary to research all of the "standard" tech in addition to your racial bonus technology in order to get to some upper level technology.  Rather, yours will either eventually give you that opportunity directly, or it has been extended to give you an equivalent end-game version that is every bit as powerful.
  - Removes all of the research bonus requirements from tech, which gives a more even playing field for all races.
    - For example, the Boskara have a -20% research malus, which slows them down, but doesn't randomly preclude them from overcoming that with perseverance.
- Moves most of the real decisions about which direction to go in research starting around the third level of tech, instead of the first two levels.
  - This lends itself to starting games where empires have some worlds already, but aren't then gifted a massive volume of tech.  Rather, they have enough to have expanded, but the core decisions about each empire are yet to be encountered, making playing a game with this advanced start more replayable and fun.
- Tech costs scale better as the game progresses.
  - giving you an early research period where you're just exploring your local system and its immediate neighbors.
  - a middle-game where tech increases apace with empire expansion.
  - a late-game where the most envy-worthy techs require a massive empire to obtain and field.
- NOTE: it is nigh-impossible to design a tech-cost scale that scales perfectly with all of the galaxy-creation options & settings.
  - turn up the difficulty, adjust tech speed, or give the AIs more relative head-starts (or both), and play with various galaxy creation options to find a good game to develop.

## Ship Components
- Ship Components have been extended to provide additional levels of various ships systems.
  - This extends some of the decisions you make to be more functional and therefore viable, allowing you to play through using efficient or energy hog designs without bumping up against as many of vanilla's arbitrary limitations, or without feeling like it's a non-choice because ultimately you're forced to choose the one and only one viable approach after a few tech levels anyway.
  - Which offers more replayability, given more distinct game-paths and strategies to explore & play-through.

## Fleets
- Slightly increased the size of standard fleets to include more and heavier ship classes.
- By default, fleets will use the 33% of fuel range as their operational theater (instead of vanilla 50% default).
  - This is tied to your personal preferences, so as soon as you override them, you can save those for future games.
  - Hopefully this makes them less prone to constantly running out of fuel.
  - And keeps them nearer to their assigned operational theater (so that they can actually perform their duty in their assigned area of space).

## Ships
- Base Cruisers were also bumped up in size to make them more significant, a work-horse of your fleets.
- Heavy ship variants have been made larger, and have a uniform increase in size over their base models.
- Ship sizes can be found here: [DW2-XL Hull Sizes](#dw2-xl-hull-sizes)
  - This offers you more fun with later tech designs, allowing you to play with some of the more exotic technologies...
  - Generally allows you and the AIs to design more balanced designs that include sensors, targeting, and a balanced array of weapons and defenses.
- Ship designs have a more natural progression.
  - First you learn how to field all of the core ship classes up to and including capital ships.
  - Then you're given the ability to research advanced variants of those ship classes in whatever order works for your empire's growth.

## Crew Quarters & Star Marine Barracks
- Marine Barracks supports the equivalent amount of crew as the corresponding crew module, at one tech level higher (thence 2x the tech cost).
  - This makes the ship designer "just work" correctly at every level (overcomes a vanilla bug in ship designer).
  - There are 4 levels of Marine Barracks to keep parity with standard crew modules.
  - They are always lower in capacity than the standard crew quarters for that tech-level (currently 80%).
  - Standard crew quarters also has a better damage reduction, and even ship cost reduction (luxury crew quarters), which marine do not have.

## Sensors
- Short range sensors give some targeting bonus.
  - This should substantially improve default and AI designs that always want a short range sensor on them.
- Long range sensors give a fleet targeting bonus.
- Reduced sizes to allow for more components on your ship designs:
  - Short range sensors are size 10
  - Long range sensors are size 20
  - End-game, extreme range sensors are size 40

## Armor
- Expanded ionic armors for all tech levels throughout the game.
- Armors don't upgrade without a refit.
- Paced out the armor for a more even game progression.
- Expanded Boskaran armors to achieve parity with the highest levels of standard armor in the game, but at a lower tech-level.
- Added a 3rd armor type specialization: Reflective Armors that focus on reflective value at the expense of strength (similar to ionic armors that trade strength and reflectivity for ionic resistance)

## Weapons
- Weapon sizes are normalized across all types.
  - Allows more predictable ship designs.
  - Gives you the ability to reason about trade-offs between different weapon systems using their many other factors, such as power use, range, alpha-damage v. sustained damage, etc.
  - Offers you and the AIs to design better ships overall (and typically more weapons at any given ship class).
  - Direct fire weapons:
    - Ftr = 5
    - S = 11
    - M = 22
    - L = 44
    - X = 50
  - Tracking weapons:
    - Ftr = 10
    - S = 13
    - M = 26
    - L = 52
    - X = 60
  - Area weapons:
    - L = 52
    - X = 60
  - Bombard weapons:
    - B = 26
    - X = 30

## Kinetic Weapons
- Do not lose damage with distance (slugs don't slow down in a vacuum, or lose energy).
  - But they continue to be quite inaccurate with range.
- Kinetic PD does more raw damage than blaster or beam PD, but it's less accurate.
- I overhauled this line of weapons to give a better progression and to make them more viable for non-humans.
  - Humans still have racial locked techs in this line, and they are just better than the standard models.
  - Humans also get a \[M\] sized variant in addition to the small and fighter mount types for autocannons.

## Energy Torpedoes
- Boskaran's Firestorm torpedo line is deeper and gives you a large weapon sooner.
  - The large variant requires a separate line of research to unlock.
- Mortalen's torpedoes line is split into fighter/small and medium/large lines.
  - All of these techs have been extended by many additional levels each to keep them viable throughout the game.

## Fighters and Bombers
- The Fighter and Bomber craft portion of the tech tree has been made more elegant and rational.
- Starfighter Hangar Bays themselves have been simplified to hold 4/8/16 craft for S/M/L bays.
  - Rather than holding more units as you tech up, they instead simply get faster at replenishing them.
    - The point being to make fighters & bombers a great tool on the battlefield, but not an automatic "I win" button.
  - So to get more fighters & bombers, you need more bays, larger ships, etc., which is a more natural flow.
    - Vanilla made them an exponentially improving weapon choice, but this mod makes them an incrementally improving weapon choice, like all other weapon platforms.

## Hyper Drives
- Experimental Warp Fields allow for nearby exploration, making for a more gradual early game.
- Have had the various types extended and balanced a bit so that every path is viable, with obvious trade-offs between lag, in flight speed, and balanced performance.
  - Snap drives are all about snappy response, but sacrifice range for a single hop.
  - Hyperstream drives are about flight-speed, and have a middling range per hop.
  - Calista Dal drives are all about range per hop, but sacrifice response time, being quite slow to spin up, as well as significantly slower than either Snap or Hyperstream.  However, they're much lower energy consumption so make for an intriguing option well suited to caslon fusion reactors.

## Reactors
- Have had the various types extended and balanced so that every major type is in-principle viable and competitive, depending on your empire's strategic situation.
  - Caslon Fusion reactors are small sized, low-power, efficient with fuel consumpiton.
  - Harmonic Caslon reactors are medium sized, mid-power, and balanced with fuel consumpiton.
  - Plasmatic Caslon reactors are large sized, high-power, fuel-hogs.
- All reactor types improve on all ares with tech, but caslon fusion remains the gas-sipping king, harmonic caslon the middle ground, and plasmatic caslon the power king.
- All reactor tech lines have been greatly extended to higher levels of tech.

## Targeting and Countermeasures
- Are size 5 for standard ones, and 15 for fleet ones.
- Have been somewhat nerfed to keep these systems from becoming too much of a "win" for high-tech fleets.  They help, they're still critical, but they're not a lock-out against your opponents.
- Sensors have integration targeting value from targeting computers as part of their dependency chain.
- Long range sensors have gained fleet targeting from dependency on fleet targeting techs.
- Sensors, targeting computers, and ship classes have been linked by dependencies to help ensure AI researches these (and it doesn't hurt the player to have some decent targeting computers for their ships, likely helps new players as well).

## Colonization
- This tech tree is more freely explorable, not requiring you to research every type of habitat in order to get to the higher levels of technology in those biomes you care about.
  - This should give you and the AIs the ability to make good use out of whatever resources can be found in your region of the galaxy, supplementing tech to make your local area colonizable, rather than needing the perfect map to have a viable and fun game.
- There is a 4th level of colonization modules
  - 50M, 100M, 150M, 200M capacity.
    - The larger capacities give the AI a much better chance of expanding at a more profitable rate without the micromanagement a Human player might indulge in.
    - Currently, the denser modules give a discount on resources required per pop, 0, 10%, 20%, and 30%.
  - Static energy requirements are much higher than vanilla.
  - Static energy cost scales with capacity (so you're unlikely to be able to have more than 1 on a single ship).
  - It is still entirely possible to use more than one module on a given colonizer, boosting your capacity further.  This is the same as vanilla, but can create ships that are hard for your economy to stomach, so use wisely.

## Planetary Facilities
- Maintenance is greatly reduced.
  - This is to make it possible to not wreck yours or the AI's economy.
  - Typically maintenance is 1% of initial build cost.

## Bug Fixes: Base Game
- Star Marine Barracks has crew which fixes those components to work as expected in the ship designer.
- Troop Academy is limited to 1 per Empire, plugging an exploit for the player (AIs didn't build more than one).

## Bug Fixes: Early versions of this mod
Fixes for bugs I introduced in previous versions of this mod, and later fixed in this version:
- Fixed a bug in Ackdarian Fast Interceptors and Bombers - event now works properly.
- Fixed a bug in Ackdarians who often get an event for maneuvering thrusters.  This now works properly.
- Fixed a bug in Mysterious Plague event -- now works properly.

Base sizes for everything except Cruiser are the same as vanilla, but cruisers were increased from 750 to 800, which gives +33% over Destroyers, which are +33% over Frigates.  Vanilla basically badly shortchanges cruisers in general.

This also allows cruisers to be your early fleet command ships - able to give up a little firepower for fleet targeting & countermeasures, including long range scanners if you're willing to give over the space.

All upgrades in DW2-XL follow a +20% over the previous technology level.  So specialized destroyers are 20% larger than their base size, allowing for a significant increase in firepower (moving from mediums to large weapons where possible, and maximizing speed, defenses, etc.)
