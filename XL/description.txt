[h2]Summary[/h2]
[list]
[*]more techs (177+)
[*]more components (56+)
[*]rebalances all racial habitability (based on how similar/different each biome is relative to each other)
[*]rebalances many components - reactors, hyperdrives, tech cost & cadence & arrangement
[*]all of it rooted in either "what I think is more fun" or "more rational" or "less un-fun than what I saw in base game"
[*]mostly - I played the game - got frustrated / angry with various things - made it better for myself - am now sharing that with you...
[*]you fly farther & faster in xl
[*]you have more distinct choices amongst branching tech (they are clearly different, and create different games if you choose one path or the other)
[*]you tech up earlier faster in xl, but later game is more drawn-out
[*]there are fewer colonizable worlds - and the ones that exist - require some terraforming & habitability techs to tame them
[*]ships have more capacity for components - so more & bigger weapons are possible on your designs
[*]the base models are much more usable
[*]the advanced versions come later in the game
[*]everything was done with an eye for helping make the AIs competitive and ensuring that it's not "just easier"[*]everything has an opportunity cost associated to it
[*]everything still requires compromises between alternatives
[*]you can't just have everything everywhere
[/list]

Please note that I designed it for veteran players [well, really, myself] - though anyone is welcome to pick it up and become a veteran by playing it.  But it is not intended to make this game easier to pick up, or easier to succeed with.  Just more replayable / rational / epic and with a lot of QOL improvements (that aren't really visible unless you've repeatedly stubbed your toe on the way they work in the base game and no longer have to suffer that here).

Which, all of which, is in fact my definition of "more fun" and why I made and keep expanding this mod.

Again, if you're curious as to the details, many of them are in the [url=https://github.com/lucky-wolf/DW2-XL#readme]README[/url]:
