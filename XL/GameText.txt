Load Designs		;Load Designs
Load Designs Explanation		;Select a design file to load from the list below.
Load Designs Explanation Long		;Note that this will only load designs that match your current tech, i.e. you have researched the hull and all components for the design.\n\nYou can load designs at any time during the game, not just at the start of the game. Thus once you have reached sufficient tech you can reload designs from the same file to add any designs that previously failed to load because of unresearched tech.\n\nAny designs that are identical to existing ones will be skipped (same hull, components and name). If a design in the file has the same name as an existing design (but is not identical) then it will be loaded, but with '(NEW)' appended to it's name.

Debris Field Encounter		;We have discovered a [DISCOVERY]vast field of space debris[/DISCOVERY] in the [LOCATION]{0} system[/LOCATION]. It appears to be the remains of an epic battle.\n\nThe wreckage includes many powerful military ships that look salvageable. We should send construction ships to this location at once to repair and recover as many of these valuable ships as possible.\n\nRepairing the advanced technology in these ships would no doubt provide research bonuses to our empire.\n\nIt may also be wise to send an armed escort along - we want to dissuade anyone else from claiming these ships. Let's keep this discovery to ourselves...

Secret Construction Project Encounter		;We have discovered a [DISCOVERY]huge unfinished construction project[/DISCOVERY] in the [LOCATION]{0} system[/LOCATION]. Under construction is an enormous mobile military base that houses a superweapon designed to destroy an entire planet! The base, named the {1}, appears to have been abandoned when it was only half finished.\n\nOnce this base is completed it would allow the possessor to dominate the galaxy. In addition, examining the advanced technology in this project would no doubt provide significant research bonuses to our empire.\n\nWe should hurry to finish construction of this enormous weapon!

Galaxy Shape Explanation Classic		;Classic galaxies have a spiral shape, with two large nebula cloud arms winding out from the center of the galaxy.\n\nThe galactic core is densely packed with stars. Moving towards the edge of the galaxy, star formations taper away, becoming less dense.\n\nBut at the edge stars once again pack together to form a distinct outer rim that surrounds the galaxy.
Galaxy Shape Explanation Spiral		;Spiral galaxies have a distinctive shape, with two large nebula cloud arms spiraling out from the center of the galaxy.\n\nThe galactic core is densely packed with stars in a two-armed spiral formation.\n\nMoving towards the edge of the galaxy, star formations taper away, becoming less dense.
Galaxy Shape Explanation Elliptical		;Elliptical galaxies have a random scattering of nebula cloud formations.\n\nThe galactic core is densely packed with stars. Moving towards the edge of the galaxy, star formations taper away, becoming less dense.
Galaxy Shape Explanation Ring No Center		;Ring galaxies contain most of their stars in a large, dense ring that encompasses the galactic perimeter.\n\nA dense nebula cloud formation dominates the center of the galaxy.\n\nSome scattered stars can be found in the middle of the galaxy.
Galaxy Shape Explanation Ring Dense Center		;Ring galaxies contain most of their stars in a large, dense ring that encompasses the galactic perimeter.\n\nAnother dense grouping of stars is found in the middle of the galaxy.
Galaxy Shape Explanation Dual Ring No Center		;Two large rings of stars encompass the galaxy - an inner ring closer to the center, and an outer ring at the galactic edge.\n\nA dense nebula cloud formation dominates the center of the galaxy.
Galaxy Shape Explanation Dual Ring Dense Center		;Two large rings of stars encompass the galaxy - an inner ring closer to the center, and an outer ring at the galactic edge.\n\nAnother dense grouping of stars is found in the middle of the galaxy.
Galaxy Shape Explanation Irregular		;Irregular galaxies have no fixed shape or structure.\n\nStars and nebula clouds are spread evenly throughout the galaxy.
Galaxy Shape Explanation Even Clusters		;Cluster galaxies have groups of stars clustered together in constellations.\n\nBetween clusters there are very few stars, thus each cluster is like an 'island' in the galaxy, separated from the next cluster by a sea of emptiness.\n\nEven clusters means that each cluster is approximately the same size.
Galaxy Shape Explanation Varied Clusters		;Cluster galaxies have groups of stars clustered together in constellations.\n\nBetween clusters there are very few stars, thus each cluster is like an 'island' in the galaxy, separated from the next cluster by a sea of emptiness.\n\nVaried clusters means that cluster sizes are varied - some are small, while others are large.

Galaxy Research Is Randomized Explanation		;Paths between research projects are randomly selected.\n\nThis means that each game has different ways to unlock new technologies.\n\nWhen combined with 'blind' research this makes each game a unique research experience.
Galaxy Research Is Static Explanation		;Paths between research projects are fixed, remaining the same across multiple games.\n\nThis makes for a more predictable research experience.

Random Seed Explanation		;Type a number here to set the random seed for the game.\n\nWhen you have the same random seed number along with the same game start settings, the same galaxy will be generated. This allows you to regenerate favourite galaxy maps from previous games.
Galaxy Shape Explanation		;The layout and distribution of stars and nebulae within the galaxy.
Star Amount Explanation		;How many stars are in the galaxy.\n\nLower amounts should only be played in smaller-sized galaxies, otherwise ships may have trouble jumping between distant star systems or finding paths between nebulae.
Nebula Density Explanation		;The amount of nebula clouds in the galaxy.\n\nLower nebula density makes navigation easier, whereas higher nebula density makes finding paths through nebulae more challenging and provides more 'geography' in the galaxy.
Galaxy Size Explanation		;The physical dimensions of the galaxy.\n\nLarger sizes should also have higher amounts of star systems so that ships can find paths between nebulae.
Expansion Explanation		;How old and developed the entire galaxy is.\n\nThis setting influences the following items: size and development level of auto-generated empires, size of independent alien populations.\n\nWhen Expansion is greater than 'Starting' then Tech Level must be at least level 1.
Your Empire Expansion Explanation		;How many colonies you have and how well established your empire is.\n\nThis includes the following factors: number of colonies, population levels at your colonies, how much of the galaxy you have explored, the number of ships and bases your empire has.\n\nWhen Expansion is greater than 'Starting' then Tech Level must be at least level 1.
Aggression Explanation		;How aggressive computer players are in the game.\n\nThere are other factors specific to each empire which also determine aggression levels, but this setting is a galaxy-wide value that influences all empires.
Difficulty Explanation		;Difficulty of gameplay. This alters the empire rates for various in-game factors relative to the player.\n\nFactors affected include: colony income, corruption, research speed, mining rate, population growth, war weariness, weapons targetting and countermeasures.
Research Speed Explanation		;How fast research occurs in the galaxy, and thus how quickly new components become available for use in ships and bases.\n\nThere are other factors specific to each empire which also determine research speed, but this setting is a galaxy-wide value that influences all empires.
Research Visibility Explanation		;When research projects become visible: either at game start or after researching parent projects.
Research Pathing Explanation		;Whether paths between research projects are fixed or random.
Pirates Explanation		;How many pirates are present in the galaxy.\n\nPirates can be a real problem, but they do have their uses...
Pirate Strength Explanation		;How strong pirates are and how fast they grow.
Pirate Proximity Explanation		;How close pirate factions start to colonized systems of empires.
Pirates Respawn Explanation		;Whether pirate factions restart after being eliminated.
Space Creatures Explanation		;How many space creatures are present in the galaxy.\n\nMany space creatures are dangerous and can pose threats to your ships and bases.\n\nHowever they may also provide resources that you can use.
Colony Prevalence Explanation		;Influences the general quality of planets and moons in the galaxy, thus determining the number of potential colonies.\n\nHigher quality planets support larger populations and provide more income when colonized.
Independent Colonies Explanation		;Independent alien populations are distributed throughout the galaxy at the start of the game.\n\nThis setting determines how many of these populations exist in the galaxy, and how large each of them are.
Colony Influence Range Explanation		;The size of influence circles that are projected out from colonies.\n\nColony influence determines your empire territory, i.e. which star systems belong to your empire.
Colonization Range Limit Explanation		;Whether colonization range limits are applied.\n\nIf turned on, new colonies must be within the specified distance from one of your existing colonies.
Race Explanation		;The dominant race at your empire's home colony.\n\nAs you colonize additional planets you can assimilate other alien populations, bringing other races into your empire.

ComponentCategory Description AreaShieldRecharge		;Area Shield Recharge component recharge the shields of other nearby friendly ships or bases by projecting a protective energy field towards them.\n\nThis can be especially useful when in battle to reinforce ships with faltering shields.
ComponentCategory Description Armor		;Armor absorbs blast damage from incoming weapons fire.\n\nWhen the weapon damage amount is less than the armor reactive rating then the armor component takes no damage. However if the weapon damage level is greater than the armor reactive rating then the armor component will be damaged or destroyed.\n\nNote that armor will not block all incoming weapons fire - some weapon blasts will inevitably make it past armor and inflict damage on the ship or base, even when the weapon damage amount is less than the armor reactive rating.\n\nSome types of weapons are better at bypassing protective armor and thus inflicting damage on the target ship or base.
ComponentCategory Description AssaultPod		;Assault Pods are used to launch boarding parties against nearby enemy ships or bases, allowing you to raid or capture the target. The armed boarding parties travel a short distance to a target and board the enemy vessel, fighting with the defenders.\n\nNote that the target ship or base must have their shields lowered before the Assault Pod can successfully board the target.\n\nAssault Pods also serve as defensive forces if a ship or base is boarded by an attacker.
ComponentCategory Description CargoBay		;Cargo storage components provide storage for cargo while being transported or stored.\n\nThese are typically used on space ports and mining stations to store resources for later use.\n\nThey are also used on freighter ships or mining ships to transport resources between locations.\n\nConstruction ships also require storage components to temporarily store resources when building new bases.
ComponentCategory Description Colonization		;Colonization Modules include everything necessary to establish a colony on a new planet.\n\nColonization modules are very large and require a lot of resources to build. These resources provide a kick start for the settlers of the new colony.\n\nSettlers are placed in stasis hibernation in the Colonization module. They can survive indefinitely until revived once they reach the new colony.
ComponentCategory Description CommandCenter		;Command Centers are the control center for a ship, base or fighter, i.e. the bridge or cockpit.\n\nCommand Centers can provide bonuses and other modifiers that improve a ship's capabilities.
ComponentCategory Description CommerceCenter		;Commerce Centers enable a base to be a center for trade, buying and selling resources and fuel.\n\nCommerce Centers can provide bonus trade income when resources or fuel are traded at the location.
ComponentCategory Description Construction		;Construction Yards allow construction of new ships and bases. They also provide facilities for repair and retrofit of existing ships and bases.\n\nConstruction Yard components are typically incorporated into space ports.\n\nHigher tech construction yards typically build and repair ships faster than earlier tech. Some construction yards can even build multiple ships simultaneously.
ComponentCategory Description Countermeasures		;Countermeasure components increase the likelihood of avoiding incoming weapons fire while in combat. These powerful electronic countermeasures throw off all types of weapons, allowing you to evade enemy weapons fire.
ComponentCategory Description CountermeasuresFleet		;Fleet Countermeasures benefit all of the ships in a fleet, allowing all ships in the fleet to more effectively evade enemy weapons fire.
ComponentCategory Description CrewQuarters		;Crew Quarters provide living quarters for crew onboard a ship or base. They also incorporate all of the vital life support systems for crew survival.\n\nAll ships and bases require sufficient crew quarters to accomodate the total crew requirements for all of the components in the design.
ComponentCategory Description DamageControl		;Damage control components reduce the amount of damage caused to a ship by enemy weapons fire. This helps a ship to survive longer in battle once their shields and armor have been penetrated.\n\nSome damage control components also provide a repair function, enabling your ships to quickly perform basic repairs even while in combat. This can improve the survivability of your military ships, extending their life while in battle.
ComponentCategory Description DockingBay		;Docking Bays enable a ship to dock and transfer cargo or refuel.\n\nDocking bays are typically represented in-game as an externally visible hangar bay. Smaller ships and fighters can enter these hangar bays.
ComponentCategory Description EnergyCollector		;Energy Collector components collect energy from a nearby star, reducing or even eliminating the need to burn fuel in a reactor to produce energy.\n\nEnergy collectors can absorb energy from a wide portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.
ComponentCategory Description EnergyToFuel		;Energy to Fuel Converters collect energy from a nearby star and use it to generate fuel for your ships. This allows you to build refuelling depots at any location, without the need to mine fuel at a Gas Giant planet.\n\nEnergy to Fuel Converters are very large and only operate while stationary. Thus they are only suitable for use on fixed bases, not ships.
ComponentCategory Description Engine		;Engines provide sublight thrust for ship movement. Each engine has its own characteristics, including thrust output and fuel consumption at various levels.
ComponentCategory Description EngineVectoring		;Vectoring Engines provide turning thrust for maneuvering a ship. Having greater agility is particularly useful when in combat.
ComponentCategory Description Extractor		;Extractors enable mining of resources from planets, moons or asteroids. These components are typically built into mining stations or mining ships.\n\nWhen mining asteroids, extractors can usually also mine several other nearby asteroids, thus increasing the resource yield at an asteroid field or planetary asteroid ring.
ComponentCategory Description FighterBay		;Fighter Bays provide facilities for manufacture, storage and repair of star fighters aboard ships or bases.\n\nOnce built into a ship or base, fighter bays can build new fighters and repair existing fighters.\n\nUnlike most ships, construction of fighters does not require additional resources - fighters can be repaired and rebuilt indefinitely by a functional fighter bay.
ComponentCategory Description FuelStorage		;Fuel Storage components provide storage of fuel to power a reactor, producing energy that can then be used for a variety of tasks.\n\nHaving sufficient fuel storage is a primary factor in determining a ship's effective travel range.
ComponentCategory Description HyperBlock		;Gravity Well Projectors generate a powerful gravity well that pulls enemy ships out of hyperspace within a defined range.\n\nThis effectively provides a safety zone where enemy ships must travel at sub-light speed, allowing more time for reinforcements to arrive in response to an attack.\n\nThese components are very large, so they are best suited to large bases like space ports.\n\nGravity Well Projectors can be defeated if a hyperdrive has a higher Blocking Insulation level than the blocking strength of the projector. In this case the ship will not be pulled out of hyperspace.
ComponentCategory Description HyperDeny		;HyperDeny components prevent any ships within range from initiating a hyperjump. This prevents enemy ships from escaping battle, allowing an attacker to destroy them.\n\nHyperDeny components can be defeated if a hyperdrive has a higher Blocking Insulation level than the HyperDeny strength. In this case the ship can still initiate a jump, even when within range of an active HyperDeny component.
ComponentCategory Description HyperDrive		;Hyperdrives enable hyperspace travel. This permits high-speed travel across the vast distances in deep space and between star systems.\n\nEach hyperdrive component has a range limit for how far it can travel in a single jump. Thus ships often need to jump multiple times between various star systems to reach a distant destination.\n\nHyperdrives have a minimum initiation time before they can begin a jump. They also have a recharge time before they can initiate another jump.\n\nEarly hyperdrive tech is quite limited and does not allow ships to travel beyond their home star system. Higher tech hyperdrives allow travelling large distances quickly and efficiently.\n\nHyperdrives do not work very well inside nebula clouds - travel speed is greatly reduced. Thus it is usually better to travel around nebulae when plotting a path to a destination on the other side of a nebula cloud. The hyperdrive navicomputer automatically determines the most efficient path to a destination from the current location.
ComponentCategory Description IonDefense		;Ion Defense components protect a ship or base against the disabling effects of Ion weapons.
ComponentCategory Description MedicalCenter		;Medical Center components provide expert medical facilities. These services can benefit the citizens of a colony if part of a base built at the colony. This increases the happiness of your citizens.\n\nMedical centers also provide rapid healing for any troops onboard the ship or base.\n\nIn addition they can help in curing any plagues that strike your colonies.
ComponentCategory Description PassengerCompartment		;Passenger Compartments allow transporting passengers on star ships. Passengers may wish to travel for either migration or tourism.\n\nPassenger storage components are built into Passenger Ships and Resort Bases.
ComponentCategory Description Reactor		;Reactors provide energy to power all the components in a ship or base.\n\nMost components use energy in some way, so reactors are critical components for all ships and bases. Some ship designs may need multiple reactor components to satisfy their energy requirements.\n\nReactors consume fuel and output energy. Caslon is the standard galactic reactor fuel.
ComponentCategory Description RecreationCenter		;Recreation Centers provide sophisticated recreation facilities. These services can benefit the citizens of a colony when they are part of a base built at the colony. This increases the happiness of your citizens.
ComponentCategory Description RemoteFuelTransfer		;Remote Fuel Transfer components allow transfer of fuel to a nearby ship without docking.\n\nThis is especially useful for Fuel Tanker ships as they top-up the fuel of ships in a fleet.
ComponentCategory Description ResearchLab		;Research Labs provide specialized facilities for your scientists and engineers to investigate new technologies and design new components.\n\nResearch Lab components are thus essential equipment on Research Station designs.
ComponentCategory Description ScannerEmpireMasking		;Empire Masking Jammers hide the empire of ship or base from long range scanners. This allows a ship or base to evade detection or appear as neutral instead of belonging to an enemy faction, e.g. a pirate faction.
ComponentCategory Description ScannerExploration		;Exploration scanners scan nearby planets, moons and asteroids to determine their resource composition and other characteristics.\n\nThey can also detect hidden items, like ancient ruins, artifacts and abandoned ships.
ComponentCategory Description ScannerExplorationSurvey		;Survey scanners allow sending a landing party to the surface of nearby planets, moons and asteroids to explore them in detail.\n\nThis allows discovery of resources and hidden items, like ancient ruins, artifacts and abandoned ships.\n\nFor deeply hidden items the survey component may need multiple survey sweeps to fully uncover the discoveries. This can take an extended period of time.\n\nSurvey scanners are the low-tech (but more thorough) counterpart to Exploration Scanners.
ComponentCategory Description ScannerJammer		;Scanner Jammers prevent a ship or base from being scanned by other ships with Trace Scanner components.\n\nScanner Jammers have a rated jamming strength. Scanning will be prevented if this jamming strength is higher than the Trace Scanner strength.
ComponentCategory Description ScannerJumpTracking		;Jump Tracking scanners allow tracking of a target as it jumps into hyperspace. This improves the ability to pursue an enemy if it flees battle.
ComponentCategory Description ScannerLongRange		;Long Range Scanners scan a large area, enabling you to see any ships or bases within range.\n\nLong range scanners can even see into neighboring systems, allowing you to keep an eye on activity there even when you do not have ships or bases present.\n\nOther components (Scanner masking, Stealth) can limit the effectiveness of long range scanners. This can defeat long range scanners, hiding a ship or base so that it is not visible, especially at longer ranges.\n\nNebula clouds also limit the effectiveness of long range scanners. Scan range is greatly reduced inside or through a nebula cloud.\n\nScanned items might be detected but may not be able to be identified: their role or empire may be unknown. This is especially true when scanned items are near the range limits of the long range scanner.
ComponentCategory Description ScannerShortRange		;Short Range Scanners scan a local area, enabling you to see any ships or bases within range.\n\nShort range scanners typically do not see much further than a single system.\n\nOther components (Scanner masking, Stealth) can limit the effectiveness of short range scanners. This can defeat short range scanners, hiding a ship or base so that it is not visible, especially at longer ranges.\n\nNebula clouds also limit the effectiveness of short range scanners. Scan range is greatly reduced inside or through a nebula cloud.\n\nScanned items might be detected but may not be able to be identified: their role or empire may be unknown. This is especially true when scanned items are near the range limits of the short range scanner.
ComponentCategory Description ScannerRoleMasking		;Role Masking Jammers hide the type of ship or base from long range scanners. This allows a ship or base to evade detection or appear as an innocuous generic ship type (e.g. instead of it's true role as a military ship).
ComponentCategory Description ScannerTrace		;Trace Scanners allow scanning another nearby ship or base to determine its cargo, onboard troops and component status.\n\nTrace Scanners can be defeated by Scanner Jammer components, which block scanning.
ComponentCategory Description Shields		;Shields are defensive energy barriers that protect a ship or base from incoming weapons fire.\n\nShields can be gradually reduced by damage from enemy weapons fire. All shield components have an inherent rate of regeneration â€“ they will restore their strength gradually over time, although typically at a much lower rate than incoming enemy weapons fire.\n\nSome shield components may also have a Resistance level below which enemy damage does not affect the shields. In other words, the damage level must be above the Resistance level to reduce the shield strength.\n\nEach type of shield component has a different speciality: some have a higher protective strength, while others are more tuned for faster regeneration.\n\nShields are often not 100% effective at blocking weapons fire, some damage may 'leak' through to strike the ship or base. In addition, some weapon types have an inherent ability to partially bypass shields.
ComponentCategory Description ShieldEnhancement		;Shield Enhancements supplement the full Shield components in providing defensive energy barriers that protect a ship or base from incoming weapons fire.\n\nShield Enhancements typically increase the rate of shield regeneration, but do not provide any shield strength of their own.
ComponentCategory Description Stealth		;Stealth components minimize a ships visibility, allowing it to evade detection â€“ particularly at long range.\n\nNote that stealth components do not make a ship completely invisible. They simply reduce its detectability by enemy sensors, increasing the range at which it can be detected.\n\nIn addition, when a stealth-equipped ship or base is detected, the Stealth ability reduces how easy it is to identify the role and empire of the ship or base. So the ship or base may just appear as an unknown item, especially when detected near the range limits of the scanner.
ComponentCategory Description TargetingComputer		;Targetting components enhance weapon firing accuracy when in combat.\n\nThese powerful computers rapidly calculate optimum trajectories for hitting an enemy target. This gives you a greater chance of scoring a hit on an enemy while in combat.
ComponentCategory Description TargetingComputerFleet		;Fleet Targeting affects an entire fleet, increasing the targeting accuracy of all ships in the fleet.
ComponentCategory Description TractorBeam		;Tractor Beams are used to pull enemy ships towards the firer for attack, or to push an enemy attacker away.\n\nThey have greater effect on smaller, nearby targets. Multiple tractor beams can be used to provide greater pull or push power.\n\nTractor Beams are especially useful for boarding and capturing enemy ships. They are also effective at preventing fleeing enemies from escaping.\n\nNote that Tractor Beams do not themselves inflict any damage on a target, they simply pull or push it.
ComponentCategory Description TroopCompartment		;Troop Storage components provide basic living facilities for combat troops while onboard a ship or base.\n\nYou must have sufficient troop storage space to contain the total size of all the troop units you want to carry on a ship.
ComponentCategory Description Troops		;N/A
ComponentCategory Description Diplomacy		;N/A
ComponentCategory Description AncientKnowledge		;N/A
ComponentCategory Description WeaponArea		;Area weapons send out a destructive blast wave in all directions from a single point in space.\n\nThe blast wave can be centered on the firing ship, or more commonly the weapon first travels to a point near the target, then detonates and triggers the blast wave.\n\nSome area weapons are also Ion weapons and thus target electronic components, much like an EMP weapon.
ComponentCategory Description WeaponBombard		;Bombard weapons are used to exterminate the infrastructure and population of an enemy colony, and to damage the planet itself, lowering its quality.\n\nEach different bombard weapon can specialize in particular areas: some are better at targeting military infrastructure and troops, others are better at targeting population or planet quality.
ComponentCategory Description WeaponCloseIn		;Close-in weapons come in various types, but they all have a shorter range, and are usually fast-moving with a high fire rate.\n\nVarious types of close-in weapons have differing strengths. Some might have longer range, while others may have higher raw damage, while still others may have higher rates of fire.\n\nClose-in weapons include: energy blasters, rail guns, phaser beams, laser cannons, gravity weapons, and even some types of energy torpedoes.
ComponentCategory Description WeaponIntercept		;Intercept weapons are close-in weapons systems that fire deadly bursts at incoming enemy weapons fire or nearby enemy fighters, disabling or destroying them.\n\nIntercept weapons are essential equipment for military ships, especially when facing opponents with star fighters.\n\nIntercept weapons can specialize their intercept capabilities against the following target categories: fighters, seeking weapons, direct fire weapons and full-length beam weapons.
ComponentCategory Description WeaponIon		;Ion Weapons fire blasts of ionized particles at enemy targets, temporarily disabling their weapons, engines or other components.\n\nSome ion weapons fire a single disabling bolt at their targets (like beam weapons), while other ion weapons send out an omni-directional blast wave that disables everything within range (like area weapons).\n\nIon weapons can specialize their disabling effects to the following particular categories of components: weapons, engines, hyperdrives, shields and sensors.
ComponentCategory Description WeaponStandoff		;Standoff weapons are long-range weapons that allow an attacker to target an enemy from afar, thus attempting to avoid damage to themselves.\n\nThey are typically seeking weapons, that will turn to follow a moving target. They are often also slower moving and with a slower fire-rate than close-in weapons.\n\nStandoff weapons include: missiles, energy torpedoes, some types of phaser beams, and some types of gravity weapons.

HiveMenace Pirates Request Help Description		;Hail, Dirtsider. We are not friends or allies, but you should know that the Hive, an ancient foe to all, a terror from time beyond remembering, has returned.\n\nWe have just heard from one of our picket ships that a Hive ship now approaches our system.\n\nWe will fight, but we cannot defeat them on our own. We are proud, but without your help we are doomed.\n\nIf you join us in defeating the Hive, we will join your Empire. If you stand aside then you will earn our further contempt. Know that when we are gone they will come for you.

Concerning News from Independent Traders Description		;We are hearing alarming reports from some of the independent traders visiting our stations. They say that an ancient enemy called the Hive has awakened in our region of space. It is attacking and consuming all in its path.\n\nThe traders say that other empires and even pirates are uniting to fight against it, but so far without success.\n\nIf there is truth to these tales, we should prepare ourselves in case this enemy heads in our direction.

Hive Encounter Description		;One of our ships has reported discovering an ancient ship of immense size. The ship is covered with what looks like layers of organic chitin and webbing.\n\nAs soon as their sensors began to scan the vessel, they detected a rapidly increasing power signature. It seems to be waking up and it appears to be hostile!
Hive Encounter Ship Destroyed Title		;Final Message from {0}
Hive Encounter Ship Destroyed Description		;Our ship [LOCATION]{0}[/LOCATION] has been destroyed by the hostile ancient vessel they discovered!\n\nJust before their destruction they sent a last transmission. Much of it was corrupted by some kind of jamming, but what got through was partial data from the encounter.\n\nThe transmission suggests a power level that is beyond anything we can build. It also revealed a massive number of life signatures onboard, equivalent to what a colony ship might carry.\n\nOur strategists and scientists are in agreement that this ship represents an alarming threat. We should begin preparing immediately to have any hope of survival!

Hive Pirates Offer Help Description		;[FACTION]{0}[/FACTION] sends an urgent message: Hail, Dirtsider.\n\nOur informants tell us that you may have awakened the Hive. While we are not friends or allies, the first part of our code tells us that above all else, we should fight the Hive and fight alongside those that do.\n\nThe Hive is in our oldest tales. Long ago, it is said they were an insectoid species that lived below and traveled the stars. Their minds were enslaved by the Ancient Enemy and when the Enemy was felled, the minds of the Hive broke. They know nothing but war and slaughter. Their hunger and hate are all-consuming.\n\nOur ancestors fought for centuries against the Hive. Many of our kind were destroyed, as were many of the Hive. We thought the Hive had completely disappeared - we had not heard from them for several hundred years. But it seems that at least a few still remained, lying dormant, repairing and gaining strength to strike again.\n\nUnderneath all that organic matter is still an ancient ship that can be destroyed. If you hit them with enough firepower, they will die. But it takes a lot of ships to get through their organic armor and their ability to repair. Our ancestors would band together into great fleets when faced with the Hive. That was the only way to take down the mighty Hive ships.\n\nThe Hive also use many drones, both to destroy and to board and raid. Without proper point defenses and planetary defenses, they will both shred your ships and consume your people. As you weaken, they will grow in strength. The Hive can repair and refuel themselves you give them a chance. You must strike in large numbers and keep up the fight until the Hive carrier is destroyed.\n\nIf you want our help, we'll join your fight, but only for a price. Pay us {1} credits and you will receive all the help we can send.

Fleets Military Attacks Automation Explanation		;Fleets will not automatically engage threats outside their current star system when Military Attacks are manually-controlled (see Military section in Empire Policy settings). Thus for fleets to automatically respond to threats outside their current star system you should enable Military Attack automation (Fully Automated or Suggest). In addition you should use automated fleets (not Manual fleet role) if you want them to automatically engage threats beyond their current system.

EMPIRE reports		;{0} reports

FleetEngagementRange Explanation		;Fleet Engagement Range specifies when a fleet will engage targets.\n\nDo Not Engage: the fleet will never engage enemies\nEngage When Attacked: will engage enemies only when directly attacked by them\nNearby: will engage enemy targets that are nearby\nSame Location: will engage enemy targets that are at the same location (planet and moons)\nSame System: will engage enemy targets that are in the same star system\nSector range: will engage enemy targets that are within a sector range\n33% of Fuel Range: will engage enemy targets that are within 33% of fleet fuel range\n50% of Fuel Range: will engage enemy targets that are within 50% of fleet fuel range\n\nNote that fleet engagement range overrides the engagement ranges of individual ships in the fleet. When a ship is part of a fleet it uses the fleet engagement range instead of its own engagement range.\n\nManually-controlled fleets will not automatically respond to threats outside their current star system. This is indicated by yellow text for this setting when the fleet is manually-controlled. To enable fleet engagement range beyond the current star system you should use an automated fleet role (Defend, Attack, Raid, Invade).\n\nFleets will also not automatically engage threats outside their current star system when Military Attacks are manually-controlled (see Military section in Empire Policy settings). This is indicated by orange text for this setting when Military Attacks are manually-controlled. Thus for fleets to automatically respond to threats outside their current star system you should enable Military Attack automation (Fully Automated or Suggest). In addition you should use automated fleets (not Manual fleet role) if you want them to automatically engage threats beyond their current system.
FleetFormationCoherence Explanation		;Specfies the proximity of Close Escort and Picket ships to their escorted Core ships in the fleet.
FleetAllowShipRoleReassignment Explanation		;This determines whether ships can have their 'Role Within Fleet' automatically reassigned or not. This means that whenever a new fleet lead ship is selected (e.g. when a better ship joins fleet or when the old lead ship is lost) then the Core, Close Escort and Picket ships can change.
FleetRetreatOverwhelmed Explanation		;Determines when the entire fleet will decide to retreat from a battle.

FleetOverrideShipTacticsWithFleet Explanation		;Specifies whether ships in a fleet use their own individual tactics, or instead use a common set of tactical overrides from their fleet.

ShipRoleInFleet Explanation		;Position Within Fleet specifies how the ship operates within a fleet.\n\nCore: Core ships are the most important ships in the fleet, and are escorted by the other fleet ships (Close Escort and Picket). Usually a fleet will have only one or two Core ships\nClose Escort: these ships escort the Core ships in a close defensive perimeter. When there are no enemies present or enemies are on all sides, then they will form a circular defensive perimeter around the Core ships. When enemy forces predominantly come from one direction then they form an arc defensive formation between the Core ships and the enemy ships.\nPicket: these ships escort the Core ships in a more distant defensive perimeter. When there are no enemies present or enemies are on all sides, then they will form a circular defensive perimeter around the Core ships. When enemy forces predominantly come from one direction then they form an arc defensive formation between the Core ships and the enemy ships.
EngagementRange Explanation		;Engagement Range specifies when a ship will engage enemy targets.\n\nDo Not Engage: the ship will never engage enemies\nEngage When Attacked: will engage enemies only when directly attacked by them\nNearby: will engage enemy targets that are nearby\nSame Location: will engage enemy targets that are at the same location (planet and moons)\nSame System: will engage enemy targets that are in the same star system\n\nNote that when a ship is part of a fleet, then the Fleet Engagement Range overrides the ship engagement range. In other words, when a ship is part of a fleet it uses the fleet engagement range instead of its own.
AttackRangeWeaker Explanation		;This determines how a ship will engage a target that is weaker than itself, including how it determines the optimal range to use.\n\nEvade: the ship will attempt to remain out of weapons range of the enemy target\nCautious: the ship will select an attack range that inflicts some damage on the enemy while minimizing damage to itself from the enemy\nNeutral: the ship will select an attack range that inflicts the maximum damage on the enemy while avoiding excessive damage to itself from the enemy\nAggressive: the ship will select an attack range that inflicts maximum damage on the enemy with little consideration for enemy damage against itself
AttackRangeStronger Explanation		;This determines how a ship will engage a target that is stronger than itself, including how it determines the optimal range to use.\n\nEvade: the ship will attempt to remain out of weapons range of the enemy target\nCautious: the ship will select an attack range that inflicts some damage on the enemy while minimizing damage to itself from the enemy\nNeutral: the ship will select an attack range that inflicts the maximum damage on the enemy while avoiding excessive damage to itself from the enemy\nAggressive: the ship will select an attack range that inflicts maximum damage on the enemy with little consideration for enemy damage against itself
ShipRetreatOptions Explanation		;This specifies when a ship will flee a battle location.\n\nEnemy in same System: will flee at the first sight of an enemy in the same star system\nEnemy at same Location: will flee at the first sight of an enemy in the same location\nEnemy Nearby: will flee when an enemy is nearby at the same location\nWhen Attacked: will flee when directly attacked by an enemy\nShields below 50% or any Armor damage: will flee when shields drop below 50% or any armor has been damaged\nShields below 20% or Armor below 50%: will flee when shields drop below 20% or armor is below 50%\nAny non-defense component damaged: will flee when any non-defense component is damaged, i.e. components other than shields or armor\n20% of non-defense components damaged: will flee when 20% of non-defense components are damaged\n50% of non-defense components damaged: will flee when 50% of non-defense components are damaged\nNever: this ship will never flee battle
InvasionTactics Explanation		;This determines how a ship will land troops during a colony invasion.\n\nImmediately: the ship will attempt to immediately land troops at the colony\nWhen Clear: the ship will wait until all static defenses at the colony have been cleared before invading. This includes all defending bases in orbit around the colony\nNever: the ship will never invade enemy colonies
